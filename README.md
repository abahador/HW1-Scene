# HW1-Scene
Cmpm-121 Homework 1 - Craft a scene
My scene is a cozy bedroom surrounded by grass and trees featuring two Sanrio characters Hello Kitty and Chococat.
Objects I inluded were a grassy terrain with trees, bedroom with furniture and two characters.
Cartoons with cute characters and room decor inspired me to create this scene.
The main character is Hello Kitty.
Objects I inluded and made in blender are a room (made up of walls and flooring) (+3), bed (made up of a frame, matress, blanket and pillow) (+12), lamp (+3), table (+3), window (made up of cutains and a bar) (+3), terrain with trees (+3) and two cat models (+3). Total = 30
